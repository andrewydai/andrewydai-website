        "description": "At AppFolio, I had the chance to work with their APM Plus Smart Maintenance teams. Our goal was to make a better maintenance platform for users and property managers. Some features I worked on were allowing maintenance dispatchers to dispatch robocalls for maintenance teams, writing a GraphQL server to help property managers view messaging on maintenance issues, converting a whole project to TypeScript, and more!"

        "description": "PowerAdvocate was where I first wrote code in industry and learned the process of working in a professional software environment. I got the chance to work on some cool features. For example, I workede on writing a search platform for clients to more easily find the right supplier for their supply chain. I also designed and built an internal data pipeline for many of our services to use. PowerAdvocate always pushed their employees to do what they loved too, and part of that for me was leading and creating the onboarding for the next wave of co-ops."

        "description": "My freshman year, I got an amazing opportunity to work with one my professor's, Dr. Thomas Wahl, on their research project. The research was program analysis, and our focus was on building a tool to explore all of a program's states when given some constraints. Peizun Liu, the PhD student, had already built a context-switch bounded tool; I worked on a stack-depth bound. After building the tool, we ran through many tests to determine the pros and cons of the differrent solutions"

        "description": "I've been working as a developer for Sandbox's SearchNEU team since January of 2021. Sandbox is a student led software consultancy, and SearchNEU is a community project dedicated to helping students search and learn about classes more easily. Some features I've worked on are Class Pages, which help show detailed informatin on classes, our switch to using GraphQL for our backend API, improving our Elasticsearch querying, and much more. My time here has been awesome so far, and I'm glad to be able to write code that gives back to my community."
